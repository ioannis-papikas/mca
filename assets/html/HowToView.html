<h2>Implementation How-To</h2>
<p>This application implements the path-finding algorithm in 2 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add or choose from a template the map to search into.</li>
    <li>Set a starting point and a goal point and hit 'Search'.</li>
</ol>
<p>The algorithm performs a map pre-process before the first search for each map in order to create the search graph. This could take a while (5-10 seconds), so be patient. After the pre-process is done, each search does not take more than 2-3 seconds (it dependes on the map) to be completed.</p>
<h3>Map Format</h3>
<p>If you wish to create your own map and test the algorithm to custom paths, you have to format the map in a specific, but simple, structure so that it will be recognized properly.</p>
<p>In the first two lines declare the size of the map like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
height 512
width 512
</pre>
<p>After the declaration lines, you present the map. The map must be represented in plain text. You can use any character you like, the map recognazies a valid path point as the symbol '.'. You can use any character you like for the walls. Example:</p>
<pre class="code">
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@.........@.........
@...................
@.........@.........
@...@@@@@@@@@@@@....
@...@.....@....@....
@...@.....@....@@@@.
@.........@.........
</pre>
<p>Please limit the map size up to 512x512, for better display. The algorithm is tested for up to 2048x2048. Thank you.</p>
